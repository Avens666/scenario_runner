    It consists of three attributes:
        - states ([dict{frame ID: info}]): Each dictionary contains
            information of a specific frame.
        - actors (dict{actor ID: actor info}): Dictionary with information

        - criteria (dict{criteria name: criteria info}): Dictionary with all
            the criterias and its attributes.

    The states dictionary has the following information:
        - transform: (vehicles and walkers)

        - velocity: (vehicles)
        - control: (vehicles)

        - speed: (walkers)

        - type_id:
